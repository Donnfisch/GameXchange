## Target Audience
The average gamer today wants to play the latest and greatest titles, but simply can't afford to shell out $60-80. Collectors can spend all kinds of time and money at yard sales and ebay looking for rare finds. Regardless of who you are, having access to what you want while saving time and money is a no brainer.

GameXchange is an online database designed to with the gaming community in mind. Gamers can buy, sell and trade video games from multiple platforms. The database can be updated by the users to share with the community what titles they are willing to sell or trade, and what titles they are looking for.

## Motivation
Have you ever plunked down a whole bunch of money on the latest and greatest games? Of course you have, we all do. Sometimes the latest and greatest games don't get you a lot of bang for your buck. Sometimes you realize you have a whole library of games you never play and think, *"hmm, maybe I could convert those duds collecting dust on the shelf into new ones with more mileage!"*--and come out of GameStop with one game. **If you're lucky!** Wouldn't it be nice if you could find someone willing to part with the games you wanted for the games you're willing to part with ?? Well now you can. With GameXchange you can: 

* Browse from a library of every game you could have or want
* Even find rare games or titles that are out of print!
* Proudly display your library and 
* Make a wish list of all the games you would like to play

GameXchange will do the hard work for you and find the closest match to you of someone willing to swap games. Once the match is made, it's up to both to decide if it's a fair trade or not.
